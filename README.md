# Stock Market Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for predicting stock prices using historical data. The complete workflow is demonstrated using a Jupyter Notebook, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Description
The project uses historical stock price data to train a predictive model. The workflow includes:
- Loading and exploring stock market data
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Model training
- Prediction and comparison with actual prices
- Performance evaluation using error metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- Git

### Installation
git clone https://github.com/shreyas074/Stock-Market-Prediction-Model.git

cd Stock-Market-Prediction-Model

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter

## Workflow Summary
- Data Collection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing
- Model Training
- Evaluation
- Visualization

## Performance Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Graphs are used to compare predicted and actual stock prices.

## Future Scope
- Use advanced models like LSTM or GRU
- Add technical indicators
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy using a web framework
